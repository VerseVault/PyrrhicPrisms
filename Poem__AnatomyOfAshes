Tremors
Of red kind
Of violet veins
They echo the ensembles

Whispers
Of grey kind
Of red rose rivets
They hide the tremors

Sweat streams
Of crystal kind
Of red rash skins
They are hour glasses

They converge
In dreadful doors
In silent silkworms
In sobre sojourns

A jinx in between
A jester in between

Woods
Rising up

Fire
Fuming down

Hair
Curled in
Crying out

Ashes right, left and center
Carving an anatomy of acids
