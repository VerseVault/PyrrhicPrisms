Every pyre has a Byronic Irony

Every prism has a primate prairie

Every canary has a candle cave

Even the fig fox called him Byronic

Brilliant, Benign, Brightest

When he wanted to become the magnate

He may be a business magnate

He cannot dodge the money machines

He cannot dodge the mid day magic

He cannot delude the madrigal myths

When the siesta is seismic

Being Byron is Brave

Being Buddha is Brave

Being Bismark is Bismuth

Being Bimbisara is Buxor

Shakira, Shakimaru, Shalaka

Shims, Shisms, Shivams, Shenigans

Error mirrors, myriad of moors

Abracadabra, Abracadabra, Abracadabra
